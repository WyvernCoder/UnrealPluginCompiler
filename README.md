# Why  
There are times when we need to compile plugins.  

Typically we need to create a brand new project to compile our plugin source.  But now you can compile your plugin directly through UBT - relying on a CMD batch file!  



# How  
1. Edit ``PluginCompiler.uproject`` to match your engine version.  
2. Edit ``UE`` path inside CMD file to match your engine location. 
3. Move your plugin folder to ``Plugins`` folder.  
4. Run CMD.  
5. Type your plugin folder name.  
6. COMPILING...  
7. Done!
